## The four stages of competence

When starting to learn any new subject it is important to understand where you sit in the competency scale. There are four basic levels:
1. Unconscious incompetence
    - You don’t know that you don’t know – _this is where you are when you start out. You are unaware of the vast possibilities that exist within your instrument and, more importantly, your abilities. You can stay at this level and still play guitar, but improvement beyond the basics will be minimal._
2. Conscious incompetence
    - You know that you don’t know - _this is the start of the learning curve and unless you reach this point you will never improve. You are becoming increasingly aware of your lack of knowledge and ability, and are determined to ‘get better’ - whatever that means to you._
3. Conscious competence
    - You know that you know – _you have been focused on improving various aspects of your presentation, and are working diligently at increasing your knowledge of your instrument and of music in general. You can pull off just about anything you want to, given some time to learn it._
4. Unconscious competence
    - You don’t know that you know – _you have mastered the important aspects of musicianship and your playing is effortless. You can play whatever you hear in your head without having to think about the ‘how’._

## Lead / rhythm guitar issues

Knowing how to really play the guitar is the first step. Once you can follow a chord sheet, play the chords, and string them together in a meaningful way, you are at the bottom of the stair-case. There is a long way to go to get to the top. The target is to learn how to use the guitar in context.

For instance, you can play a standard A-E-D or C-F-G sequence in hundreds of different ways. Once you have the changes down you can start looking for contrasting ways to attack the chords. Try different sounds [if you use an electric guitar with effects], or strumming patterns, legato or staccato, make each note stand out or play them all at once, a brighter or a warmer sound / tone, open chords or play higher up the neck - so many possibilities. Which one/s you use depends entirely on context.

This breaks down into three areas of concern:
1. The sound you will use
2. Which inversions of the chords you will use, and
3. The way you will play those notes / chords

But you have to have a reason for which methods you use because merely playing along mindlessly has no point. At all.

# Sound

## Basics

## Headroom

## Vol vs Gain

- Line-in / -outs
- Cables and jacks
- DI – when to use it [and when not to]
- Terminology issues
- Sound-chain from source to speaker

## The Sound field

As the sound engineer your job is to mix the sound coming off stage in such a way that it sounds good anywhere in the room. Once this is achieved you can focus on what is known as the ‘sound field’. This is the spatial placement of each element in the mix into a three-dimensional matrix in such a way that they complement each other. It is a broad subject, but the basic concept is easy to grasp. It works as follows:
- Left and Right panning of a channel gives the matrix width
- Reverb can create a sense of depth
- Volume can create the effect of height

Starting off with a standard MONO mix ie. all the channels are panned to the centre so that the sounds are coming equally from the left and right speakers. They are in effect clumped together in the centre of the sound field. There will be a varying amount sound coming off stage from the monitors [if the musicians aren’t using In-Ears] as well as the guitar amps and more importantly, the kit. You will have to deal with these on an individual basis.

Imagine a horizontal line running across the front of the stage from left to right situated at the point where musicians start to hear the PA above the stage volume.

## Where to put them all

**Vocals:** While you should leave the lead vox in the centre you can create some lateral space around them by panning the backing vox further to left or right while adding some reverb to push them back from the front of stage a little [not enough to muffle them completely, mind].

**Kit:** Start with the kick at centre, the snare off-set slightly left and the hats right. Pan the toms left, centre and right [if there are 3 toms].

**Guitar and bass:** Pan them away from their side of the stage ie. if the guitar or bass amp is on stage left pan their channel slightly right and vice versa.

These are some very basic guidelines – you will have to use your discretion in all cases.

### Balancing acts

## Mixers
- Analog / digital desks
- How mixers work
- How a channel on the mixer works
- Auxiliaries

## EQ
- Room
- PA
- Voices
- Instruments

## Effects
- Reverb
- Delay

## Microphone choice and usage

### Voice

### Instruments

### Kit

## Monitoring

### Speakers

### In-ear

## Things to consider

- The placebo effect
- The subjectivity of listeners
- Prima donnas / Divas

## A good sound fulfills these criteria
- Not too loud / not too soft
- You can hear everything that is being sung / played on stage
- The lead vocal is clear
